As a token of our appreciation for speaking at Cincinnati Software Craftsmanship, we'd like to send you a special {CSC} speaker t-shirt.

These are the shirts that we have been using and we are pretty happy with them. You can choose from women's or unisex.

Please let me know what size you would like and where we can send it to. We'll get it processed right away.

Thanks,
Michael
