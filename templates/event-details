TRANSPORTATION:
Atrium Two is conveniently located in downtown Cincinnati, easily accessible by bus, car, bike, or scooter.

PARKING:
There are a variety of parking options near Atrium Two, many for $5 or less. Most on-street parking is limited to 60 minutes, so we recommend using a parking lot or garage. The garage at 406 Main Street is the most convenient and is also reasonably priced. Alternatively, you can explore parking options on the Best Parking website:
